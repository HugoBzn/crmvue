This app works like a user manager, you can save users and his data and you can edit, delete and create more users. üë®üë©

This project is working with Formkit to do all the form and properties https://formkit.com/

This App is working with a local API, created with json-server (npm) https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server
To serve this API after you install json-server, you need to run the next code

```sh
json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
```
Now the API is working and you can see how the project works!!! Enjoy!!!

This idea is from a course made it by Juan de la Torre (Udemy) ü§ì.

## Important
You need to have two consoles, the first one running the project and another one running the API. üßê
